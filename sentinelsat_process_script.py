"""
Script to call the download and processing of images to make calving front images for Polarportal.

Calls function sentinel_process in sentinelsat_functions.py. This file also contains all other functions required for processing EXCEPT for the function glacier_definitions in sentinalsat_glacier_definitions.py.

Variables to specify:
from_date: string formatted 'YYYYMMDD' or 'NOW' or 'NOW-kDAYS' where k is integer
to_date: same as above
download_directory: string containing the target directory to place downloads.
unprocessed_image_directory: string containing the directory of unprocessed images (for clearing it)
processed_image_directory: string containing the directory where the processed calving front region images will be placed
image_type: string containing the used band in the Sentinel download. Can be bands 'B01' through 'B12' or 'TCI' (true-color image)
max_cloud_percentage: integer. Only downloads images with set percentage of cloud cover as classified by ESA algorithm
download: bool to control whether or not the images should be downloaded. If downloaded, all images in the directory unprocessed_image_directory will be deleted. Allows for code development of image processing with already downloaded images, without having to download again. Defaults to True.
glacier_list: list of glaciers to download and process images for
